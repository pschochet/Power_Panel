# Power_Panel contains a Shiny R dashboard that performs power analyses for three commonly used panel data designs: (1) difference-in-differences (DID), (2) comparative interrupted time series (CITS), and (3) interrupted time series (ITS). The calculations apply the methods developed in Schochet (Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, 2022) that allow for a host of real-world issues that arise in practice for causal inference analyses using panel designs. These include variation in treatment timing, autocorrelated errors, unequal measurement intervals, clustering due to the unit of treatment assignment, and the inclusion of model covariates to improve precision and adjust for confounding bias.
